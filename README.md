Final group project for Software Engineering GSU CSC 4350/6350

The problem we have chosen to address is the creation of an Android software application (app) that will translate mathematical symbols and numbers drawn by the finger of the user onto the touch screen of a device into the text equivalent of the same symbols and numbers entered using a word processor with mathematical capabilities. We believe this will allow for a much more streamlined user experience when entering complex formulae and equations when on a mobile device, since alternatives available for the entry of mathematical symbols are often either too complex for the average user (like Latex), or so simplistic as to only allow for very limited functionality (ie. The standard calculator on a mobile device).  In addition, the app will be able to export the translated mathematical symbols to the Wolfram Alpha API for processing and evaluation, and will be able to show the data from WA to the user, and save it.
